# Machine Learning Cheatsheet

## Process
- Frame the Problem
- Get the Data
- Discover and Gain Insights for the Data
- Prepare the Data
  - Split Data Stratified sampling
  - Correlations
  - Attribute Combinations
  - Feature Scaling
  - One Hot Encoding Categorical Attributes
- Model Training (algorithms for Linear Regression)
  - Normal Equation
  - SVD
  - Gradient Descent
  = Batch GD
  - Stochastic GD
  - Mini-Batch GD
- Select & Evaluate Training Model
  - Bias-Variance TradeOff (Regularization)
  - Cross Validation
  - Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves
  - Validation curves
- Fine-Tune the Model
  - Grid Search

## Performance Measures
- Root Mean Square Error
- Mean Squared Error
- Mean Absolute Error
- F1 Score
